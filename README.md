Project Goal:

The goal is to develop a regression model that accurately forecasts the number of bikes rented for a given hour.

This information can be valuable for bike-sharing companies to:

Optimize bike distribution across stations
Manage staffing levels
Improve user experience by ensuring bike availability
Data

ðŸš²This project utilizes two datasets:

ðŸš²Historical Bike Rental Data:
This data likely includes information like:

Timestamp (hourly)
Number of rentals
User type (registered/casual)
Day of week
Season


ðŸš²Weather Data:
This data might contain:

Temperature
Feels-like temperature
Humidity
Wind speed
Weather condition (categorical)


Note: The specific data format and variables might differ depending on the source.

ðŸš²Methodology

This project employs regression analysis to build a model that maps historical usage patterns and weather data to hourly bike rental demand. Here's a potential workflow:

Data Loading and Cleaning: Load both datasets, handle missing values, and address any inconsistencies.
Feature Engineering: Create new features if necessary (e.g., combining temperature and wind speed into a "wind chill" factor).
Model Building: Train a regression model (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest) on the combined dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared on a separate test set.
Model Tuning (Optional): Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
Running the Code
This section should detail the steps to set up the project and run the code. It might involve:

Installing required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn)
Specifying the data location
Running scripts for data pre-processing, model training, and evaluation
Note:  Specific instructions will depend on the chosen implementation.

Further Exploration
Model Selection: Compare the performance of different regression models.
Feature Importance: Analyze which features contribute most to the model's predictions.
Seasonality: Account for seasonal variations in bike rental demand.
Real-Time Integration: Integrate the model into a system that consumes real-time weather data for continuous predictions.
